## What is Lithcoin?

LTCO is a utility token built on **Polygon** for fast, low-cost transactions. It powers payments within the **McJohnson Wallet** and enables seamless transactions across a growing ecosystem of mini-apps.

### Core Principles

- **Utility Token**: LTCO is designed for transactional use—not as an investment or security. It facilitates payments and settlements within applications.

- **Polygon Network**: Built on Polygon PoS for sub-second confirmations and transaction costs under $0.01.

- **Growing Ecosystem**: LTCO is integrated with the McJohnson Wallet and will support mini-apps built using our SDK, creating a community-driven utility network.

## Key Features

Built for functionality, not speculation.

### Fast & Affordable

### Mini-App Ready
Developers can integrate LTCO payments into applications built with the **McJohnson SDK**.

### Open & Transparent
All transactions are verifiable on-chain. No hidden rules or centralized control.
